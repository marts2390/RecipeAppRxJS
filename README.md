# Hello There!

Welcome to my test, I hope you like it!

It's built with Create React App so just run 'npm run start' and npm will do the rest.

I built this using the BLoC pattern methodology to allow better understanding and readability, and also scalability. Read more about it here:

The UI is helped along by Material UI developed by the clever guys and gals at Google. 

Enjoy!
